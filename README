#: |            Brief Description           |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: Script cliappmenu.sh is a menu of CLI applications and commands
#: to help CLI newbies to discover what a command line can do.
#:
#: The typical user is anyone who wants to learn about what types of
#: command line applications are available.
#:
#: Admittedly, the some of the files for this script are big 50-100 KB,
#: and this script has not been tested on PCs slower than 1 GHz.
#:
#: Start by downloading the file "cliappmenu.sh" and follow the instructions
#: to install the application.
#:
#: You can either download all the script project files at once, or
#: just download the file "cliappmenu.sh" and use the script to interactively
#: download just the features you wish to use.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |       HOW-TO Install this script       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The simplest method to install is to download the file "cliappmenu.sh"
#: to the directory of your choice. This is the main script file.
#:
#: Run the script by typing "bash cliappmenu.sh".
#: 
#: When running the script for the first time, the mini-installer will
#: automatically download any required library files.
#:
#: Additional software library module files will be downloaded on-demand.
#:
#: If you wish, you may also download all the files at once and then
#: decide which library module files you wish to discard.
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |  FILE LOCATIONS of cliappmenu project  |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The main script, cliappmenu.sh may be located in a different directory
#: from the rest of the files, if you wish. Or you can put all files in the
#: same folder/directory.
#:
#: Common locations: User's home directory /home/<username>, /usr/local/bin,
#:                   /opt directories.
#:
#: Specify the folder/directory where the script cliappmenu.sh file
#: resides by setting $MAINMENU_DIR variable within function
#: f_initvars_menu_app in the script file, cliappmenu.sh.
#: _______________________________
#:
#: You may have all the script's files in a single directory or have the
#: library files and support files in their own separate directory from
#: the "cliappmenu.sh" script file.
#:
#: If you want to use the optional suggested default directory:
#: /<MAINMENU_DIR>/cli-app-menu
#: it should contain files: EDIT_HISTORY, COPYING, README, LIST_APPS,
#: library files (lib_cli-*.lib) and module library files (mod-apps*.lib).
#:
#: Specify the folder/directory where the library and module library files
#: reside by setting $THIS_DIR variable within function f_initvars_menu_app
#: in the script file, cliappmenu.sh.
#: _______________________________
#:
#: The configuration file: .cliappmenu.cfg 
#: is a hidden file which resides in the user's home directory.
#: _______________________________
#:
#:
#: Append the directory name to your environment $PATH:
#: Edit your /home/<username goes here>/.bashrc or .bash_profile or .profile
#: file and add the directory by adding the lines to the end of the file,
#:                   PATH=$PATH:<User-chosen directory path>/cli-app-menu
#:                   export PATH
#:
#: When cliappmenu.sh is run i.e. "bash cliappmenu.sh",
#: then you can download selected module files, "mod_apps-*.lib."
#: The module files contain sub-menus of various applications.
#: A list of applications is in LIST_APPS.
#:
#: You may download all or as few module files as you wish.
#: You may delete any module files that you do not need.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: | HOW-TO Set the PATH with file locations|
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: The session-wide (pertaining to a specific user only, not system-wide)
#: setting of the PATH variable can be done in several ways.
#:
#:
#: 1. Within a GUI environment using a terminal in a window:
#:    reads ~/.bashrc.
#:
#: 2. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    reads ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login
#:    Note: If you invoke a GUI environment using "startx" from the CLI,
#:          then you must edit
#:          both    ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_profile files
#:          or both ~/.bashrc and ~/.bash_login   files.
#:
#: 3. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    reads ~/.profile.
#:    Note: If you invoke a GUI environment using "startx" from the CLI,
#:          then you must edit
#:          both    ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile files.
#:
#: 4. Non-interactive, non-login shell environment:
#:    reads the file contained in the variable BASH_ENV, if exists.
#:__________________________________________
#:
#: Detailed information about options 1-4.
#:
#: 1. Within a GUI environment using a terminal in a window:
#:    Only for Bash shells in a graphical environment in a desktop session.
#:    (i.e. Xterm window session already logged in through the GUI Gnome, KDE).
#:    WILL NOT WORK in a pure CLI environment login shell.
#:    (i.e. ~/.bashrc will not work in a pure CLI environment login shell).
#:
#:    /home/<username_goes_here>/.bashrc
#:                             ~/.bashrc
#:
#:    Edit the ~/.bashrc file
#:    and add the following line to the end of the file.
#:                             PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cli-app-menu
#:
#:
#: 2. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    Only one of these files needs the new PATH statement.
#:
#:    Will work in most shells in either
#:    a graphical environment in a desktop session (i.e. Xterm window session).
#:    or a pure CLI environment login shell.
#:
#:                             ~/.bash_login
#:                             ~/.bash_profile
#:
#:    Edit either the ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile file
#:    and add the following line to the end of the file.
#:                             PATH=$PATH:$HOME/cli-app-menu
#:
#:
#: 3. Within a pure CLI environment without a GUI (Gnome, KDE, XFCE, etc):
#:    The ~/.profile is read last after the ~/.bash_login and ~/.bash_profile.
#:
#:    WARNING: Ubuntu ignores ~/.profile
#:    if ~/.bash_login or ~/.bash_profile exists.
#:    So edit ~/.profile only if you do not have either of the above files.
#:
#:    Will work in most shells in either
#:    a graphical environment in a desktop session (i.e. Xterm window session).
#:    or a pure CLI environment login shell.
#:
#:    /home/<username_goes_here>/.profile
#:                             ~/.profile
#:
#:    Edit the ~/.profile file and add the line below to the end of the file.
#:                             export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/cli-app-menu"
#:
#:
#: 4. Non-interactive, non-login shell environment:
#:    reads the file contained in the variable BASH_ENV, if exists.
#:
#:    (Not pertinent or relevant since this script is interactive).
#:    Included here to document another way to set the PATH variable.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why did I write this script?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: I wrote this script for 3 reasons:
#: 1. I wanted a categorized list of command line applications.
#: 2. I wanted to learn bash scripting, i.e. functions, looping, tests.
#: 3. I couldn't find a cli menu to launch cli apps on the web so I thought I'd
#:   give back to the community and perhaps others could build on and improve
#:   on what I've started.
#:

#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |      Why is this menu so complex?      |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *The menus are designed to be quite extensible and are easily edited.
#:
#: *Menu item choices are added with a simple comment line.
#:
#: Why not use the select command? Why not be a lazier pattern matcher?
#:
#: *I used to be a MUMPS programmer and QA analyst.
#:
#: *I used to create menus in this style in MUMPS and being a QA person, my job
#:  was to try to break programs. So that's why I tried to make pattern matching
#:  reasonably robust.
#:
#:       Please see function "f_menu_item_valid"
#:       in library module "lib_cli-common.lib."
#:
#: *My QA background also explains this crazy documentation of everything along
#:  with the fact that I am just learning bash scripting.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |             Script features            |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: *Optimized for 80x24 display or 640x480 pixel displays.
#:  Run-time displayed text is no wider than 80-columns across.
#:  Run-time menus are no longer than 16 items for 24 row displays.
#:  Although the game, "Pacman for Console" needs 32 rows minimum to play.
#:
#: *You can change it to display more rows (lines) by changing MENU_ITEM_MAX
#:  within function, f_show_max_menu_items in file, lib_cli-common.lib.
#:  Default MENU_ITEM_MAX=16, can change to MENU_ITEM_MAX=<Max. number of lines>.
#:
#: *You can get application help by 'man' or '--help' from the menu prompt.
#:
#: *If an application is not installed, the script can install it using package
#:  managers apt, rpm, slackpkg, pacman or for specific apps, download it from
#:  a web site for manual installation.
#:
#: *If an application needs sudo, script will automatically give a sudo option.
#:
#: *Designed for ease of extensibility and menu editing. No menu item numbers,
#:  and no custom pattern matching is required for each menu item added.
#:
#: *Menu item option numbers in menu display are automatically generated.
#:
#: *More fun than just a list of CLI applications!!!

#: |       HOW-TO Add a new menu item       |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: New category menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#: The template to add a new category menu is:     f_menu_cat_sample_template
#: The template to add a new sub-category menu is: f_menu_scat_sample_template
#:
#: New application menus are in the file lib_cli-menu-apps.lib.
#: The template to add a new application menu is:  f_menu_app_sample_template
#:
#: In brief:
#
#: 1. The menu code is contained in functions with example templates. 
#:
#: 2. If you are adding a NEW APPLICATION within an application menu,
#:    a) An application menu can have a **MAXIMUM OF 16** items.
#:       If you have more, please create a new sub-menu or sub-category menu.
#:       This is to comply with a 80x24 line screen which is standard.
#:    b) decide what row in the menu that you want to place the new menu item.
#:    c) Add the new menu item see below for menu format details.
#:    d) Each Special Menu Option Marker MUST be unique for each menu.
#:
#:    Note: Please see bottom of this document
#:          for a list of Special Menu Item Markers.
#:
#:    e) Create a menu item and possibly any custom functions needed.
#:       Example:
#:    f_menu_cat_sample_template () {
#:          f_initvars_menu_app "BXX"
#:          until [ "$BXX" = "0" ]
#:          do    # Start of <Sample Template> Application Category until loop.
#:    #0^0^0^0^0 #MXX appname1  - Description Application1 name.
#:    #1^0^0^0^1 #MXX appname2  - Description Application2 name.
#:    #0^1^0^3:NC^0 #MXX appname3  - Description Application3 name.
#:    #1^1^1^19^1 #MXX appname4  - Description Application4 name.
#:
#:    appname1 - Has no custom functions before running application, appname1.
#:
#:    appname2 - Has <field 1> a custom function f_appname2 to run before
#:               running application, appname2.
#:               Will display a "Press 'Enter' key to continue." message after
#:               running application, appname2.
#:
#:    appname3 - Has <field 2> custom install function, f_install_appname3
#:                will run before running application, appname3.
#:
#:               Custom install functions run if the distro's software package
#:               manager fails to install the application if it is missing.
#:               Usually the custom install function will download, compile
#:               source code from the software maintainer's web site.
#:
#:               Has <field 4> a Quit-Code "3:NC" which displays message below
#:               without clearing screen:
#:
#:                                To quit "appname3", type "Q" or <F10>
#:
#:    appname4 - Has <field 1> a custom function f_appname2 to run before running
#:               application, appname2. This will run before any custom install
#:               function.
#:
#:               Also has <field 2> custom install function,
#:               f_install_appname3 which will run before running appname3.
#:
#:               Custom install functions run if the distro's software package
#:               manager fails to install the application if it is missing.
#:               Usually the custom install function will download, compile
#:               source code from the software maintainer's web site.
#:
#:               Also has <field 4> a Quit-Code "19" which displays message below
#:               after clearing the screen:
#:
#:                         To quit "apapname4", type <Ctrl>-Z or <Ctrl>-C
#:
#:               Also has <field 5> which displays:
#:                         "Press 'Enter' key to continue".
#:
#:    f) Format of Menu: 
#: <Menu item options> <SPACE> <Special menu item marker> <SPACE> 
#: <Application name> <SPACE> - <SPACE> <Description>.
#:
#: Format of menu item options:
#: "#f_funct1^f_funct2^f_funct3^Quit-Code^PRESS_KEY #MXX App Name - Description."
#:   field-1  field-2  field-3  field-4   field-5   Marker 
#:
#: field 1    *if 1 then function name is f_<MENU_ITEM_NAME>.
#: 1/0/string *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#:            *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:
#: field 2    *if 1 then function name is f_install_<MENU_ITEM_NAME>.
#: 1/0/string  A function to install an application may be specified here.
#:            *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#:            *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:
#:             This custom installation function is called only after the
#:             distro's software package manager has failed to install the
#:             application usually because the application is not pre-packaged
#:             for the linux distro (distribution).
#:             See f_application_install for more details.
#:
#:             If install fails, then this custom install function will be run
#:             to download the source code from the application maintainer's
#:             web site then compiles and installs the application.
#:
#: field 3    *if <string> then function name is <string>.
#: 0/string   *if 0 then ignored. No function is run.
#:             This function is run after displaying the Quit-Code on screen.
#:
#: field 4    *Quit-Code. See f_quit_app_clause for more details.
#: string
#:
#: field 5    *Sets PRESS_KEY=0/1 to display "Press 'Enter' key to continue".
#: 1/0         See f_press_key for more details. This allows the user to see any
#:             messages displayed by the application after it has been run.
#:             Without PRESS_KEY=1, the screen is cleared for the menu to display
#:             and the user would miss any messages.
#:
#:             This setting may be overridden by any custom functions which
#:             follow. It is useful if the custom function displays a help
#:             message for the menu to display so you don't have to worry
#:             about coding for PRESS_KEY within that custom function.
#:
#:             This can be used to initialize PRESS_KEY as it is set before any
#:             custom functions in fields 1, 2, or 3 are run.
#:
#:    g) Update the file LIST_APPS by selecting "Configure" THEN "LIST_APPS"
#:       in the Main Menu. LIST_APPS is used by the Main Menu item "List
#:       Applications" to show a list of all applications available whether
#:       the app module is downloaded or not.
#:
#: 3. If you are adding a NEW CATEGORY or SUB-CATEGORY menu, please create them
#:    within the appropriate module file mod_apps-*.lib and please use the
#:    templates for this very purpose available in mod_apps_sample_template.
#:    Template: f_menu_scat_sample_template.
#:
#: 4. If you are creating a NEW MAJOR CATEGORY, 
#:    a) Create a new corresponding module file, mod_apps-*.lib.
#:       Use template f_menu_scat_sample_template to create the menu structure.
#:    b) Add the new menu item in lib_cli-menu-cat.lib.
#:    c) ALSO UPDATE the README file, "List of Special Menu Item Markers".
#:    d) Update the function f_create_LIST_APPS within lib_cli-common.lib with
#:       the name of the new module file so that the text file LIST_APPS can be
#:       re-created.
#:    e) Edit functions f_ask_which_module_download, f_module_match in 
#:       file lib_cli-common.lib.
#:
#: 5. The file LIST_APPS may be automatically updated by copying all the 
#:    mod_apps-*.lib files to the current directory and by selecting
#:    "Configure" then "LIST_APPS" in the Main Menu.
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |   Trouble-shooting a new menu item     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. Some or all of the menu items are missing.
#:
#:    If you copied from a template or another menu, check the markers.
#:    Check the Special Menu Item Markers for consistency.
#:    In the example below, #MXX is before each menu item and in DELIMITER.
#:    Note: DELIMITER has #MXX twice, separating it into 3 fields for awk.
#:
#:     Example: "MXX" is the Special Menu Item Marker.
#:              In this example app2name (with "MAA") will not show in the menu.
#:
#:    f_initvars_menu_app "MXX"
#:    until [ "$MXX" = "0" ]
#:          #MXX appname  - Description Application1 name.
#:          #MAA app2name - Description Application2 name.
#:    DELIMITER="#MXX" #MXX This 3rd field prevents awk from printing this line
#:                          into menu options.
#:    read MXX
#:    f_menu_item_process $AEE  # Outputs $MENU_ITEM.
#:    unset MXX MENU_ITEM  # Throw out this variable.
#:
#: 2. Impossible to exit a menu.
#:
#:    *Somewhere in the mod_apps-*.lib file, there is a syntax error.
#:    *Check the Special Menu Item Markers for consistency. (See point 1).
#:     Example: If "unset MAA" instead of "unset MXX" then exiting menu using
#:              "(R)eturn" will not work, while "0" (zero) will still exit.
#:
#: 3. Strange menu results, menu does not display.
#:    *If you forget the closing "}" to a function, you'll get strange results.
#:    *If you forget a comment "#" marker i.e. "} End of function", then menu
#:     may not even display.
#:
#: 4. Only a few of the Menu items display when the number or letter is selected.
#:    Check any instance of echo with only a single double-quotation mark.
#:    Change from: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote.
#:    Change   to: echo "I forgot to type in the trailing double-quote."
#:
#:
#: +----------------------------------------+
#: |     Known problems and limitations     |
#: +----------------------------------------+
#:
#: 1. All associated files for this script must be in the same folder,
#:    except for cliappmenu.sh which may be in a separate folder. 
#:
#: 2. f_choice_array needs all menu items to have 1 or 2 unique words in a name
#:    within the same menu.
#:
#:    i.e. Acceptable names for a menu    Unacceptable names for a menu 
#:
#:      WAN Applications Menu          WAN Applications Menu
#:      ip route                       ip route list
#:                                     ip route flush
#:
#: 3. Option for automatic software installation only for distributions which
#:    use apt, rpm, slackpkg, and pacman; all others must install manually.
#:
#: 4. For Slackware-based distros which use slackpkg, even though you can
#:    install software, I have not figured out a way to determine if
#:    "slackpkg install <package name> was successful or not. 
#:    The command results in error code zero $?=0 even if install fails.
#:    As a result, I commented out the code which traps slackpkg installation
#:    errors, shows an error message and asks if you want to download the
#:    source code from the developer's web site.
